# 📊 Sales, Profit & Customer Insights Dashboard (Power BI)

This project is an end-to-end **Business Intelligence dashboard** built using **Power BI**, designed to analyze sales performance, profitability, customer behavior, and operational trends from transactional data.
---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The dashboard helps answer key business questions such as:
1. How are "sales and profit" performing over time?
2. Which "categories and sub-categories" drive profit vs losses?
3. What is the "customer, payment mode, and regional" distribution?
4. How do "orders, quantity, and profit margins" vary across dimensions?

The goal is to simulate a "real-world analytics use case" for business decision-making.
